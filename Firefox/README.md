# SendToTrello

This is a Firefox plugin for sending a snippet of a page you are visiting to a trello board. It's still under development, so be aware of some troubles.

## How to find the ListID needed for the settings page?

1. Go to your trello account and open a board. The URL should look like this, but with your details https://trello.com/b/jdEfynKy/thunderbird
2. Add a .json extension to end of the URL.  https://trello.com/b/jdEfynKy/thunderbird.json
3. Then find the list you want to start adding snippets to, if you don;t have a list you need to create one first.
4. Your list id is there (search for it by name): 

```
 name	"Test" //this is the list name
 id	"5c04e63970f1d12bc5686***" //this is the ID you are looking for
 ```
